/*
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no divisors other than itself and 1. 
Write a function that accepts a number and returns true if it’s a prime number, false if it’s not. 

The tests are looking at the efficiency of your solution (number of operations) as well as correctness!

*/

// Note: The test suite will just hang if your solution isn't effecient.
// If it doesn't pass after a few seconds, you probably need to refactor.

// function primeTester(num) {

function primeTester(num) {
